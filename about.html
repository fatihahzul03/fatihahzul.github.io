			<h2>ABOUT ME :) </h2>
			<p>Hi, this is my homepage, so I suppose I should introduce myself. It might be difficult to introduce oneself at times since you know yourself so well that you don't know where to begin. Let me give it a shot to see what type of image you have. about myself through my self-description I'm hoping that my perception of myself has improved and your feelings towards me are similar. Here it is. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are several things I like to do, see, and experience I enjoy reading and writing. I enjoy thinking and dreaming; I enjoy talking and listening. I like to learn and explore new things.</p>
			<p>I am a computer science student at UiTM Arau, Perlis. I don't have any foundation in computer science. This is because, during high school I was an art stream student but this did not stop me from exploring new things.  </p>
